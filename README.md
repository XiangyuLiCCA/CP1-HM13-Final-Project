Lazy Drummer

Assembling a robot with arduino can help me play my mid-term project.

Summary

Since my mid-term project is a program written in Java, I use the keyboard to achieve the purpose of drumming. But since I don't play drums, I have to go through a certain amount of training to be able to play the songs skillfully. So I plan to use programming to make a robot that can play my mid-term project by itself. And later I can also modify the code to let it play other instruments made with code.

Component Parts

Arduino Uno, Breadboard, micro servos with horns x3, wires, external keyboard, drum sticks x3.
How to connect please see the assembly tutorial.jpg

Timeline

Week 0: Write Proposal

Week 1:Search online for the way the server works, plan how the robot works, and sketch out the basic working conditions.

Week 2:Start programming and adjust the servo.

Week 3:Assemble the robot, make the drum sticks, add and adjust the keyboard, and make sure the robot can strike the board well.

Week 4: Present!

Challenges

Since the robot requires three servos, each servo has a different response to the code due to quality issues. At first, due to insufficient supply voltage, the servor turned very slowly and could not be rotated to the angle I needed. When I replaced the power supply, I found that the angle of the initial work of each servo is different. Therefore, I have written a set of work instructions for each servor to ensure that they work in the same state.
Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
